# Plotly_BellyButton

## Overview
For this project, I assisted a biological researcher who is trying to discover bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. This research is specifically focused on the bacteria that is found in human belly buttons. Bacteria from participants from across the county has been analyzed and is available to view on the web. The identify of all individuals is anonymous but each participant can look up their own information by entering their assigned id number into the web site dashboard that I developed using the following resources:  

-	VS Code as the text editor to create and edit HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files. 
-	JavaScript, including the Plotly library, and CSS to create attractive, interactive data visualizations. 
- JavaScript to manipulate, parse, and transform data.
-	Chrome Developer Tools to view, inspect, and debug the visualizations. 


## Results

Program participants select their ID from a drop-down menu to learn about the bacteria that was found in their belly buttons as seen in the following print screen:
